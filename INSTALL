Instructions

1. Decompress the Mahalo ParserFunctions installation archive - this
   will create a directory called 'mahaho-parserfunctions'.
2. Locate your MediaWiki installation directory ($IP) and place the
   mahalo-parserfunctions directory under $IP/extensions
3. Activate the individual extensions you'd like to use by adding the
   appopriate require() line to your LocalSettings.php file.
   
For example, to activate the ImageLink extensions (which adds the 
{{#imageLink}} function), add this line to your LocalSettings.php file:

   require_once('extensions/mahalo-parserfunctions/mhoImageLink.php');

That's it!
