= Introduction =

The `{{#imageLink}}` parser function allows you to link internal images to external URLs or internally to other wiki pages.

= Usage =

Once [Installation installed], users of your wiki will be able to use imageLink on any page.   The syntax is as follows:

{{{
{{#imageLink:<image>|<url or page title>|<alt text>}}
}}}

Where:
 * `<image>` is the name of an uploaded image file, for example "some-picture.jpg" or "Screenshot.png"
 * `<url or page title>` is either an external URL of the form `protocol://path/to/resource`
  * _Note: only protocols returned by MediaWiki's `wfUrlProtocols()` method are accepted for external links._
 * `<alt text>` is optional title text to display when a user hovers over the image.

= Examples =

For example, to link an image called `mahalo-logo.png` to mahalo.com, you could use:

{{{
{{#imageLink:mahalo-logo.png|http://www.mahalo.com}}
}}}

-or-

{{{
{{#imageLink:mahalo-logo.png|http://www.mahalo.com|Mahalo.com}}
}}}

Where the latter will display "Mahalo.com" when the user hovers over the image.
